# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

This is a full example Java SE console-based project implementing the Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) specification.

See `USAGE.md` for quick start and `test-data/` for sample CSVs.

🚀 Features

Student Management → Add, list, update, deactivate students.

Course Management → Add, list, update, deactivate courses; search & filter.

Enrollment & Grading → Enroll students, enforce credit limits, record marks, compute GPA.

Transcripts → Generate student transcripts with letter grades.

File Operations → Import/export CSV datasets, backup system with recursion.

Reports → GPA distribution, top students, course enrollments.

⚡ Technical Demonstrations

This project is designed to showcase Java concepts:

Core Java

Primitive types, operators (arithmetic, logical, relational, bitwise).

Decision structures → if, if-else, nested if, switch.

Loops → for, while, do-while, enhanced for; includes break, continue, and a labeled jump.

Arrays & Arrays utility methods (searching/sorting).

String operations → substring, split, join, equals, compareTo.

OOP & Type System

Encapsulation → private fields, getters/setters.

Inheritance → Person (abstract) → Student / Instructor.

Abstraction → abstract methods in Person.

Polymorphism → toString() overrides, service interfaces, transcript rendering.

Access Modifiers → private, protected, public, and package-private.

Constructors & super calls in inheritance.

Immutable Class → CourseCode.

Nested Classes → one static and one inner class.

Interfaces → Persistable, Searchable<T>; diamond problem resolution via default methods.

Lambdas & Functional Interfaces → Comparators, Predicates.

Anonymous Inner Class → callback in CLI.

Enums → Semester, Grade with fields & constructors.

Advanced Concepts

Casting → upcasting, downcasting with instanceof.

Overloading & Overriding.

Design Patterns:

Singleton → AppConfig.

Builder → Course.Builder, Transcript.Builder.

Exceptions:

Checked & unchecked exceptions.

Custom exceptions → DuplicateEnrollmentException, MaxCreditLimitExceededException.

try/catch/finally, multi-catch, throw / throws.

Assertions for invariants (IDs non-null, credit limits).

Java APIs

NIO.2 → Path, Files (copy/move/delete).

Streams API → filtering, mapping, GPA aggregation.

Date/Time API → enrollment dates, backup timestamps.

Recursion → compute backup directory size.

📊 Datasets

Located in the datasets/ folder:

students.csv

instructors.csv

courses.csv

enrollments.csv

Example students.csv:

id,regNo,fullName,email,status,enrollmentDate
1,REG1001,John Doe,john@example.com,ACTIVE,2023-09-01
2,REG1002,Jane Smith,jane@example.com,ACTIVE,2023-09-02

📥 Running the Project
Compile
javac -d bin src/edu/ccrm/**/*.java   # Linux/Mac
# or on Windows PowerShell
dir -Recurse -Filter *.java | ForEach-Object { $_.FullName } > sources.txt
javac -d bin @sources.txt

Run
java -cp bin edu.ccrm.cli.MainCLI

Run with Assertions
java -ea -cp bin edu.ccrm.cli.MainCLI

🖥️ CLI Demo Flow

On start → AppConfig (Singleton) loads config.

Main menu:

1. Manage Students
2. Manage Courses
3. Enrollment & Grading
4. Reports
5. Import/Export Data
6. Backup & Utilities
0. Exit


Import datasets → datasets/students.csv, etc.

Enroll students, record grades, print transcript.

Export & run backup (timestamped folder).

Reports → top students, GPA distribution.
